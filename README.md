a self-introduction program for CIS 4160

Hello everyone!

I'm Julia and I am Queens-based New Yorker studying in Baruch as a Computer Science major with a minor in Mathematics. 

A few things about me:
1. I have a tuxedo cat named Cookie that I took in from the streets
2. My mom and I are both Geminis ♊️
3. Current food obsession is raw seafood (I love omakase!!!)
4. I have a big passion for the arts and I do film photography for fun using a Honeywell Pentax Spotmatic in 35mm

I'm super excited to further hone my craft during my time in this class. 

I'd love to guess everyones' zodiac sign for fun!
